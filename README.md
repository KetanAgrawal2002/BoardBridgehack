# Text Extraction Demo

This repository demonstrates the usage of two model APIs for text extraction from documented forms and handwritten images. The APIs provide a convenient way to extract text from various sources and can be integrated into your own applications or projects.

## API Documentation

The following APIs are used in this project:

1. Documented Forms Text Extraction API: https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/to-be/donut-base-finetuned-invoices
   - This API allows you to extract text from forms and structured documents.

2. Handwritten Text Extraction API: https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/microsoft/trocr-base-handwritten
   - This API is specifically designed to extract text from handwritten images or scanned documents.

## Demo Website
The demo website allows users to select between the two text extraction options:

1.Documented Forms Text Extraction
This option utilizes the Documented Forms Text Extraction API to extract text from forms and structured documents.

2.Handwritten Text Extraction
This option uses the Handwritten Text Extraction API to extract text from handwritten images or scanned documents.
The selected option will lead the user to the corresponding text extraction functionality.
